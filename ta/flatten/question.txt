Flatten a tree
Question

Implement a method that, given a tree as a parameter, will return an inorder traversal of that tree.

Your implementation should throw an IllegalArgumentException if the tree is null.

Your implementation must implement the FlattenTree interface
For example a tree like:


  /|\
 1 | 6
  /|\
 5 4 9

would result in the list [1,5,4,9,6].
Coding
Your class must be named flatten.MyFlattenTree
