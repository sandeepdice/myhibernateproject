Flatten a tree
Question

Implement a method that, given a tree as a parameter, will return an inorder traversal of that tree.

Your implementation should throw an IllegalArgumentException if the tree is null.

Your implementation must implement the FlattenTree interface
For example a tree like:


  /|\
 1 | 6
  /|\
 5 4 9

would result in the list [1,5,4,9,6].

  /|\
 1 | 6
  /|\
 5 | \
   |  \
  /|\  \
 A B C  \
       / | \
      F  G  H
 
 [1,5,A,B,C,F,G,H,6]
 
Coding
Your class must be named flatten.MyFlattenTree










		/**
		 * Old Logic
		 */
		// if tree's left is Leaf, get the leaf and add to list
		// if tree.get().isLeft() is true, tree.get().ifLeft(function to traverse Leaf)
		// if tree.get().isLeft() is false, tree.get().ifRight(function to traverse Triple)
		// else tree.get
		
		// if tree's mid is Leaf, get the leaf and add to list
		// if tree's left is a Node, flatten the node
		
		// if tree's right is Leaf, get the leaf and add to list
		// if tree's right is a Node, flatten the node
